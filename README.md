## Why Vole?
From an article:
    " Voles are small rodents with a heavy body, short legs and blackish to grayish brown fur that reach up 5 to 8 inches long at maturity. There are six species of voles in California that experience dips and peaks in populations -- which can leave gardeners wondering at the sudden appearance of holes in their garden. Voles are active all year during the day and night. They create multiple small round holes roughly 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter connected by above-ground paths traveling through low-growing plants that can hide them from view. Voles prefer to feed on leafy vegetables and tubers and will leave chew marks on your plants roughly 1/8 to 3/8 inch long, in irregular places at different angles. "

Voles felt approiate with a system designed to maintain and repair, despite the real-life creature doing the opposite.
